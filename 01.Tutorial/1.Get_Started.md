## Architectural Fundamentals
PostgreSQL uses a client/server model.

The PostgreSQL server can handle multiple concurrent connections from clients. To achieve this it starts (“**forks**”) a new process for each connection. From that point on, the client and the new server process communicate without intervention(介入) by the original postgres process. Thus, the **supervisor server process** is always running, waiting for client connections, whereas client and associated server processes come and go.
