## Architectural Fundamentals
PostgreSQL uses a client/server model.

The PostgreSQL server can handle multiple concurrent connections from clients. To achieve this it starts (“**forks**”) a new process for each connection. From that point on, the client and the new server process communicate without intervention(介入) by the original postgres process. Thus, the **supervisor server process** is always running, waiting for client connections, whereas client and associated server processes come and go.

## Creating a Database
``` bash
createdb # create a db with the name of current user
createdb mydb # create a db with the name mydb
dropdb mydb # drop the db named mydb
```

## Accessing a Database
``` bash
psql mydb
```

### SQL commands
``` psql
SELECT version();
SELECT current_date;
SELECT 2 + 2;
```

### Internal commands
The **psql** program has a number of internal commands that are not SQL commands. They begin with the backslash character, “\”.
``` psql
\q # get out of psql
```
