# Advanced Features

## Views
``` sql
CREATE VIEW myview AS
    SELECT name, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location
        FROM weather, cities
        WHERE city = name;
```

## Foreign Keys
maintaining the **referential integrity** (参照完整性) of your data

``` sql
CREATE TABLE cities (
        name     varchar(80) primary key,
        location point
);

CREATE TABLE weather (
        city      varchar(80) references cities(name),
        temp_lo   int,
        temp_hi   int,
        prcp      real,
        date      date
);
```

## Transactions
The intermediate states between the steps are not visible to other concurrent transactions,
and if some failure occurs that prevents the transaction from completing,
then none of the steps affect the database at all.

PostgreSQL actually treats every SQL statement as being executed within a transaction.
If you do not issue a BEGIN command,
then each individual statement has an implicit BEGIN and (if successful) COMMIT wrapped around it.
A group of statements surrounded by BEGIN and COMMIT is sometimes called a *transaction block*.

### ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO
``` sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Alice';
SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Bob';
-- oops ... forget that and use Wally's account
ROLLBACK TO my_savepoint;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Wally';
COMMIT;
```

## [Window Function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-window.html#TUTORIAL-WINDOW)
A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.
**Window functions do not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row like non-window aggregate calls would**.

``` sql
SELECT depname, empno, salary, avg(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY depname) FROM empsalary;
```

A window function call always contains an OVER clause directly following the window function's name and argument(s).

``` sql
SELECT depname, empno, salary, rank() -- rank() 是 orderby 语句的排名
    OVER (PARTITION BY depname ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM empsalary;
```

The rows considered by a window function are those of the “virtual table”
produced by the query's FROM clause as filtered by its WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses if any. 

For each row, there is a set of **rows within its partition** called **its window frame**.

## [Inheritance](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-inheritance.html)

``` sql
CREATE TABLE cities (
  name       text,
  population real,
  elevation  int     -- (in ft)
);

CREATE TABLE capitals (
  state      char(2) UNIQUE NOT NULL
) INHERITS (cities);
```

``` sql
SELECT name, elevation
    FROM ONLY cities
    WHERE elevation > 500;
```
